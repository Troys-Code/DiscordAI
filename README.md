## Discord AI Bot 
 
This project sets up a Discord bot that interacts with users through text messages. The bot leverages AI models to generate text responses and corresponding images based on user messages. 
 
### Summary 
 
This Discord bot combines the power of AI text generation and image generation to provide more immersive and comprehensive responses to user messages. By leveraging an LLM pipeline, the bot captures the essence of the user's message and generates a text response that aligns with it. The AI image generator then produces an image that complements the generated text. Together, these components create a more engaging and contextually relevant user experience on Discord. 
 
### Code Flow 
 
1. The Discord bot listens for incoming messages from users. 
2. When a message is received, the bot passes the message content as a prompt to the AI language model (LLM) pipeline. 
3. The LLM generates a text response based on the prompt, capturing the essence of the user's message. 
4. The generated text response serves as a prompt for the AI image generator. 
5. The image generator generates an image that aligns with the essence of the text response. 
6. The bot sends the generated text response back to the user on Discord. 
7. If an image is generated, the bot also sends the corresponding image to the user. 
 
### AI Capturing the Essence for Prompting the Image Generator 
 
The AI models in this code demonstrate the ability to capture the essence of a user's message and effectively prompt the image generator. By analyzing the input message, the AI language model generates a text response that encapsulates the core themes and elements of the user's message. This response serves as a prompt for the image generator, guiding it to generate an image that complements the text and effectively captures the essence of the user's original message. This skill enables the AI to provide more contextually relevant and cohesive responses by aligning the generated image with the generated text. 
 
### Flow Graph 
 
The following flow graph illustrates the sequential steps of the code, highlighting the text generation and image generation process:
